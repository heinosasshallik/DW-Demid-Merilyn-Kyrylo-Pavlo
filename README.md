- Shot’i: what exactly he saw in the spirit realm.
- Antha/St. Igritt: why they share a last name; what the connection means.
- Bob: fate of his missing relative Paul (kidnapped lead/stake).

## Grim Portents (current adventure)
- Skul sacrifices captive villagers and reanimates them as Servants of the Cinder Queen (ongoing). The first sacrifice already happened; a scream echoed through the catacombs.
- Skul gains access to the Catacomb Library.
- Skul locates the Book of Rains.
- Skul reaches the Sealed Caldera.
- Skul reverses the Ritual of Stone-sealing, breaking the planar seal.
- Gildarthe and her Flaming Host are unleashed.

## Stakes
- Will Hvitr strike the party (or an enemy) when St. Igritt petitions a lightning bolt?
- What is the St. Igritt–Antha family connection?
- What happens to Paul (Bob’s missing relative)?
- Can the party stop Skul before he breaches the seal?

## TODO
- Nail down player-facing item statlines: Skoldir armor bonus (+1 or +2?), Atgir tags (reach/near/thrown, damage mod?), lightning triggers/downsides for non-devotees.
