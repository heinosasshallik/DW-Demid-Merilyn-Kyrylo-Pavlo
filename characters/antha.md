# Antha Dreacer (Bard)

- Player: Merilyn
- Race/Look: Half-elf (not obvious); knowing eyes, wild hair, finery, fit body; funny-shaped ears, likely sees better in the dark.
- Drive: Adventure
- Background: Raised in a cleric convent but never felt the calling; pivoted to art (dance, song, poetry, painting—her body and tools are the instruments). Invited to high-society gatherings to produce concise “conclusions”/notes; important people covet her summaries. Very young, still green. Half-elf heritage unclear.
- Hook: Received a letter (no signature) hinting her ancestry is tied to Hvitr’s monastery; came to investigate. Has a web of contacts.
- Boon: Boon of St. Igritt (from session 1).
- Relationships: Shot’i trusts Antha the most.
- Outstanding questions: What is the name of her convent? Which god, if any, is tied to her ancestry/convent?
- New discovery: St. Igritt shares Antha’s last name—determine the connection.
