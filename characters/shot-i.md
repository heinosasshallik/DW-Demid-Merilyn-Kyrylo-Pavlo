# Shot’i (Wizard)

- Player: Kyrylo (black hair)
- Race/Look: Githyanki; sharp eyes, styled hair, stylish robes (turtleneck enchanted), thin body; scarred from childhood punishments.
- Drive: Power — command respect and prestige with magic.
- Background: Escaped harsh “Creche” schooling; trauma is the source of power. Punishes jerks; nightmares are common (largely ignored). Fire magic appeals; warned about tropical forests in omens.
- Social: Githyanki are rare here; people react oddly to his appearance and magic.
- Questions to answer: What price did you pay to learn magic? Where does magic come from? How common is magic and how do people react? What dire omens have you foreseen?
