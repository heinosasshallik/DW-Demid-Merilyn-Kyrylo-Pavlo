# Catacombs Loot & Boons

- **Lightning Spear (Hvitr’s Boon)**  
  - Conducts lightning; can channel a lightning strike when invoked (Antha-only trigger). Possible multifunction staff with a diamond tip (uncertain).  
  - Electrical discharge if handled improperly (was zapping when pried).

- **Magnetized Shield**  
  - Electromagnetic pull; can trap/hold metal objects; useful for climbing or disarming. Was stuck to metal in the vault puzzle.
  - Can hold a heavy rectangular metal bar with such strength that STR-1 users can’t pry it off; a STR+2 fighter can.

- **Boon of St. Igritt**  
  - St. Igritt will petition Hvitr to send a lightning strike on the party’s behalf. Hvitr is angered by the tomb desecrations (Bob was the main desecrator), so the strike could be aimed at a party member if displeased; resolve at use time.

- **Amber Crystals (spent)**  
  - Oxygenating ignition crystals: set fire to anything flammable they touch; turn sulfur-laced solidified lava back into molten lava; do not ignite normal stone; likely harmless on non-magical metal (magical metal unknown). Party currently has none (Forobor expended his; disciple’s cache lost/unknown).

## Vault / Puzzle Notes
- Puzzle combined righteousness + distance/safety; shield and spear were magnetized/zapping when grabbed. Solution likely to use rope/insulation/“worthy use” answer to avoid destruction.
