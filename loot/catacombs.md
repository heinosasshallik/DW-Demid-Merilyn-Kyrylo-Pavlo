# Catacombs Loot & Boons

- **Atgir — Spear of St. Sigrid (Atgir and Skoldir set)**  
  - Reach, thrown, near, (damage: base spear, no bonus), 1 weight. Ash haft, steel point, silver lightning inlay. Light for its size.  
  - If you are not devoted to St. Sigrid and pick it up, you take 1d6 lightning (drop it).  
  - If you wield both Atgir and Skoldir: any foe that deals you melee damage is forcefully repelled.

- **Skoldir — Shield of St. Sigrid (Atgir and Skoldir set)**  
  - Armor bonus TBD (+1 standard shield? possibly +2 while raised vs. enemies of Truth); 2 weight. Large rectangular ash shield banded in steel with four silver lightning bolts from a central boss.  
  - If not devoted to St. Sigrid and you pick it up, you take 1d6 lightning (drop it).  
  - Skoldir’s magnetism can clamp a heavy rectangular metal bar so firmly STR-1 users can’t pry it off; STR+2 fighter can.

- **Boon of St. Igritt**  
  - St. Igritt will petition Hvitr to send a lightning strike on the party’s behalf. Hvitr is angered by the tomb desecrations (Bob led), so the strike could be aimed at a party member if displeased; resolve at use time.

- **Amber Crystals (spent)**  
  - Oxygenating ignition crystals: ignite anything flammable; turn sulfur-laced solidified lava back to molten; do not ignite normal stone; ordinary metal seems unaffected (magical metal unknown). Party has none left (Forobor spent his; disciple’s cache lost/unknown).

## Vault / Puzzle Notes
- Atgir & Skoldir puzzle combined righteousness plus distance/insulation; grabbing triggered shocks and magnetism. Likely solvable with rope/insulation/declaring a worthy purpose to avoid destruction.
