# Catacombs - Session 1 (detailed)

### Entry and collapse
- Hvitr pounded the mountain with lightning; a rockfall sealed the entry tunnel. The way in is blocked—must find an alternate exit.

### First clash (entrance zone)
- Fought 2 servants and 1 disciple (sparkbearer). The disciple escaped left, toward a sulfurous/steam area (lava vents).
- Spirit guidance: Skul is to the left, so the party headed that way.

### Sparkbearer / amber crystals
- Disciple carried oxygenating **amber crystals** that ignite anything flammable on contact.  
  - Combine with sulfur-laced solidified lava → re-melts into molten lava.  
  - Do not ignite normal stone. Metal: ordinary metal seems OK; magical metal unknown.  
  - Solidified lava is light; glows when heated.  
  - Skeletons see heat (otherwise blind).  
  - Sparkbearer chants to snuff flames (counterplay).  
- Forobor spent his amber; party currently has none. Suspect the Staff of Cinders might house more.

### Tomb desecrations and Hvitr’s displeasure
- Party desecrated two tombs labeled “Br.” (Brother) — angering Hvitr (consequences pending).

### Spirits (Forobor’s lore and vision)
- Spirits are ever-present energies, neither good nor evil; they take whatever forms they prefer. They grow stronger with prayer, offerings, or sacrifice; neglect or disrespect can sour them.
- Most people can’t see spirits; Forobor (and Shot’i) can perceive and commune.
- Mountain spirit (muddy, stony) asked Forobor for a rune he knows; showed visions of people dragged, killed, resurrected. Warned: Skul’s hindrance lies to the left; a disciple disappeared to the right. Guidance nudged the party left toward sulfur/lava vents.

### St. Igritt’s tomb (stalactites overhead)
- Discovered St. Igritt (Saint) shares Antha’s last name.
- Looted two magic items and received a boon (lightning spear + magnetized shield + boon of St. Igritt).  
  - Lightning Spear channels Hvitr’s lightning (Antha can call a strike).  
  - Magnetized Shield can clamp a heavy metal bar so hard STR-1 can’t pry it; STR+2 fighter can.
- St. Igritt granted a boon: she will ask Hvitr to deliver a lightning strike for the party. Possible consequence: Hvitr, already angered by tomb desecration (led mainly by Bob), may target a party member with that lightning.
- As they finished, lantern-bearing figures appeared down the corridor (session end).
- This chamber is a dead end; to continue they must backtrack through the three-way hall maze.

### Puzzles / vault hints (not yet fully explored)
- Shield/spear puzzle: righteousness + distance/insulation likely needed; grabbing triggered zaps; magnetism stuck gear to metal.
- Vault inscription (seen via the Eye of Einarth idea): “Offer a copper for thy sins, a silver for the keep—swear the golden virtue and gain the entry you seek.”

### Open leads
- Track the escaped disciple toward Skul (sulfur/lava-vent side).
- Identify lantern-bearers—friend, foe, or neutral?
- Handle Hvitr’s anger.
- Investigate Staff of Cinders for hidden amber.
- Seek other exits from the catacombs (entrance blocked).
