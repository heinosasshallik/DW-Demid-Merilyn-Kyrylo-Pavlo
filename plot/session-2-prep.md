# Session 2 Prep — Hvitr’s Horn Catacombs (detailed)

## Immediate situation
- Entrance is rockfallen (Hvitr’s lightning); party must find another exit.
- Lantern-bearing figures are entering near St. Igritt’s tomb. Pick their faction: disciples of Skul, servants with sparkbearer support, or neutral custodians.

## Hvitr / St. Igritt boon
- St. Igritt will petition Hvitr for a lightning strike to aid the party. Hvitr is angry about the tomb desecrations (Bob led); consequence: the strike could target a party member if Hvitr is displeased. Decide if/when the boon is called and who/what gets struck.

## Amber crystals (sparkbearer tech)
- Properties: oxygenate/ignite anything flammable on touch; turn sulfur-laced solidified lava back to molten; do not affect normal stone; ordinary metal seems safe (magical metal unknown). Solidified lava is light and glows when heated. Sparkbearer chant can snuff flames. Skeletons see heat (otherwise blind).
- Party has no amber left (Forobor spent his). Staff of Cinders may contain a cache. Decide enemy use: sparkbearer bombs, traps, or area denial near the sulfur vents.

## Pursuit / navigation
- Escaped disciple fled left toward sulfur/steam (lava vents) where Skul’s “hindrance” lies (per mountain spirit). Right path had the disciple vanish in the vision; left is priority.
- Provide alternate exit leads: side lava tube, detour around collapse, or featherfall route (if they find the Hvitric featherfall scroll).

## Encounters to stage
- Lantern-bearers + heat-vision skeletons synergy (light vs. heat). Use heat sources or absence of heat as tells.
- Sparkbearer with chant counterplay; let players learn/steal the chant.

## Lore / hooks to surface
- St. Igritt–Antha surname connection: inscriptions, family crest, records in vault/library.
- Bob/Paul hook: rumors of captives, a prisoner ledger, personal keepsake near disciple’s trail.

## Puzzles / vaults
- Copper/silver/gold offering vault (“Offer a copper for thy sins, a silver for the keep—swear the golden virtue and gain the entry you seek”).
- Shield/spear magnet puzzle fallout: magnetized shield can lock a heavy bar; lightning spear shocks if mishandled. Confirm if further traps remain.

## Library & vault leads (not yet explored/looted)
- **Library**  
  - *Libram of Lox Lontoric*: gives loose-earth control spell (like Mold Earth); learnable by Druid or Wizard; book crumbles after use.  
  - *Book of Rains / Stonesinging*: takes ~3 minutes to sing; can make or reinforce a Hvitr seal (bardic/ritual flavor).  
  - *Hvitric scroll of featherfall*: one-use feather fall.
- **Vaults (items & effects)**  
  - *Eye of Einarth*: see through one solid object when touching it.  
  - *Jafnir — Hammer of Thunder*: close, thrown, forceful, two-handed, +1 damage, 4 weight. Returns to hand when called; cracks stone with thunderous blow.  
  - *Glass of Rain*: 1 weight; invert to drip—clouds gather, Lawful creatures nearby gain +2 armor while not attacking; when water runs out, they take +2 forward to next attack. If destroyed, sudden downpour grants fire immunity until next cloudless day.  
  - *Black Gloves*: worn, 0 weight; hands become impervious to fire of all kinds.  
  - *Spakri — Cloak of Wind*: worn, 1 weight; step skyward and roll +WIS to ride the wind up to a day’s journey (choices on 10+/7-9 to avoid exhaustion/attention/overshoot).  
  - *Staff of Cinders*: close, near, 1 weight; burning ember tip deals 1 damage to holder every few moments. Can call forth smoke to obscure; can send a tongue of flame (roll +INT: on 10+ deal damage+INT ignoring armor; on 7-9 choose one: something else catches fire, unintended target hit, staff turns to ash).  
  - Coin/gem hoard in vault; ornate door with offering slot (copper/silver/gold text).

## Open questions to resolve in play
- Who are the lantern-bearers serving?
- Where is the Staff of Cinders, and does it hold amber?
- Will Hvitr’s wrath manifest beyond the lightning boon?
